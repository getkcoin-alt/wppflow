# leadVico — Sales CRM with Integrated Calling

A frontend-only prototype of an enterprise sales CRM, built for client presentations. Every screen works and shares the same mock dataset. Calls, stage changes, notes and tasks appear on the right timelines, dashboards and reports straight away.

```bash
cd crm
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # static build in dist/ (deploys to any static host)
```

**Stack:** React 19 · TypeScript · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Zustand · Recharts · lucide-react. There is no backend. The data comes from a seeded generator (`src/data/seed.ts`), and its timestamps are set relative to the current time so the workspace always looks current. Reload the page to reset the demo.

## Modules

## 5-minute demo script

1. **Dashboard.** Open with the greeting, pacing sentence and KPIs. Switch the date range and point out the heatmap.
2. **Leads → Hot.** Filter, then bulk-assign two leads. Open a lead profile and walk through the score breakdown and timeline.
3. Press **Call**. Let the transcript stream with Vico AI prompts, toggle hold and record, then **End call**. In wrap-up, pick an outcome and keep "Schedule follow-up" on, then save. The call, recording and task appear on the timeline immediately.
4. **⌘K → "Simulate incoming call"**, then answer it.
5. **Pipeline.** Drag a deal to *Closed Won* to trigger the celebration, open the deal drawer, and try Undo from the toast.
6. **Calling → Start dialing.** Show the power dialer moving to the next lead after each wrap-up.
7. **Team / Reports / Settings.** Show the leaderboard, forecast and loss reasons, then switch the currency to INR and the theme to dark.
